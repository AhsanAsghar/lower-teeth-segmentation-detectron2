This repository focuses on tooth numbering for lower teeth images. With this notebook, you can train a Detectron2 model on the Lower-Teeth dataset and predict the model's output. It also allows you to generate instance masks for each tooth along with their corresponding tooth numbers!

You need to download the dataset from Roboflow. (You need to gather the dataset and then annotate each tooth with the corresponding labels. Annotation must be done by polygons)

After the dataset is ready, download it from roboflow. 

Register your dataset with detectron2.

Train the model. 

Test the model. 


Predicted Result:
