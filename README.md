This repository focuses on tooth numbering for lower teeth images. With this notebook, you can train a Detectron2 model on the Lower-Teeth dataset and predict the model's output. It also allows you to generate instance masks for each tooth along with their corresponding tooth numbers![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b2bc8d9f-fce6-4586-97be-9dfaae3264c2)
